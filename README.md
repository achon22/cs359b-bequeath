# CS359B Project Bequeath 
We are building a smart-contract based decentralized trust fund to allow for the secure transfer of crypto-assets on the Ethereum blockchain. This dapp allows users to pass on their fungible and non-fungible assets to a designated party (or several designated parties in sequential next-of-kin fashion) who can claim the assets after a certain lockup period set by the grantor elapses. We implement both revocable and irrevocable trusts that support the bequeathal of Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens, and ERC-721 tokens.
